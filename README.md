# AI Projects

This repository is a growing collection of notebooks and experiments
focused on **modern LLM application development**.

The goal is to move beyond basic prompt usage and into
**tool-using systems, RAG pipelines, agents, and real-world AI applications**.

## Planned & Ongoing Topics

The repository will cover (incrementally):

- **Tools Use & Function Calling in LLMs**
  - Calling external functions/APIs from LLMs
  - Structured outputs and tool orchestration

- **LangChain Fundamentals**
  - Chains, prompts, and model wrappers
  - Understanding abstractions without magic

- **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)**
  - Document ingestion and chunking
  - Vector stores and semantic search
  - Query-time retrieval + generation

- **AI Agents and Memory**
  - Single-agent and multi-step agents
  - Short-term and long-term memory patterns
  - Decision loops and tool usage

- **Applied AI Projects**
  - Conversational interview assistants
  - RAG-based question answering systems
  - UI-driven LLM applications using tools like Gradio

## Structure (will evolve)

ai_projects/
│
├── notebooks/ # Colab notebooks for experiments and learning
├── agents/ # Agent-based experiments (future)
├── rag/ # RAG pipelines and retrieval experiments
├── utils/ # Shared helper functions
└── README.md

Structure will remain simple and intentional.
Only notebooks worth keeping are committed.

## Notes

- Notebooks are uploaded **without execution outputs**
- Code is exploratory and learning-focused
- Some notebooks may be partial or iterative by design
- This is not a production repository (yet)

## Purpose

This repository exists to:
- Build a solid mental model of LLM systems
- Practice implementing real AI workflows
- Serve as a reference for future projects
- Track progression from basics → agents → applications

---

This repo is expected to evolve as understanding deepens.
